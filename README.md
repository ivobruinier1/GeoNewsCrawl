# GeoNewsCrawl

GeoNewsCrawl is a Python-based repository containing scripts for data extraction, processing, and analysis in the domain of geographic news data. The repo includes tools for:

- Data extraction and processing  
- JSD (Jensen-Shannon Divergence) testing  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) model training  
- NER label prediction with optional confidence thresholding  
- Coordinate prediction leveraging Wikidata  

Additionally, the repo provides a runnable HTML demo to showcase functionality.

## Features

- Python scripts for multiple stages of geographic news data handling  
- NER model training and inference with configurable confidence thresholds  
- Coordinate extraction using Wikidata as a reference  
- JSD testing to analyze data distributions  
- HTML demo for quick visualization  

## Important Notes

- The datasets required to run the scripts are **not publicly accessible** due to restrictions.  
- Some scripts require API accounts (e.g., for external data sources), which means limited accessibility out of the box.  
- To use this repository effectively, **modifications to the scripts are necessary** to accommodate your own data sources and API credentials.
